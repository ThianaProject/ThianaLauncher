# ThianaLauncher
Thiana's current codebase is in a private repository, which I will open to access once it is working properly.

## Other

I want to add a lot of extra features, and I'm still not satisfied with some of the UI designs. At the same time, my busy life means Thiana's development time could be very long.

Currently, I am the only one developing it, and writing so much code is an extremely difficult task.

I'm just not happy with the launcher I'm using.
