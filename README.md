# ThianaLauncher
Thiana's current codebase is in a private repository, which I will open to access once it is working properly.

## Feature (TODO)
- Built from scratch, with no legacy code
- Get rid of the monotonous whiteboard UI by using (slightly modified) Material 3 design
- I forgot

## Development progress
> This will not be updated regularly unless I remember.

- **UI Design:** 40% (I've been modifying the basic styles, which has resulted in the UI not being very complete)
- **Account Login**: 30% (UI not sorted out)
- **Game Download**: 0%
- **Community Resources Download**: 0%
- **Run Minecraft**: 0%

## Other

I want to add a lot of extra features, and I'm still not satisfied with some of the UI designs. At the same time, my busy life means Thiana's development time could be very long.

Currently, I am the only one developing it, and writing so much code is an extremely difficult task.

I'm just not happy with the launcher I'm using.
